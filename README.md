## Some things to note
* This mod uses SCS Software's DAF 2021 truck sounds from 1.46 of ETS2. No sounds are my own creation.
* I don't intend to update this mod with any other sounds for the DAF or for other trucks.
* I will try to keep the mod up-to-date with the latest versions of ETS2 where possible.
